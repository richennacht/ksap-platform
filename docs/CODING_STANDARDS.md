# KSAP E-commerce Management Platform - Coding Standards and Contribution Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and contribution guidelines for the KSAP E-commerce Management Platform. Adhering to these guidelines ensures code quality, consistency, maintainability, and facilitates collaborative development. All contributors are expected to familiarize themselves with and follow these standards throughout the development lifecycle. This platform is being developed by Manus AI.




## 2. General Principles

### 2.1. Readability and Clarity

Code should be easy to read and understand. This means using clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Avoid overly complex logic and strive for simplicity. Comments should be used to explain *why* certain decisions were made, rather than *what* the code does (which should be evident from the code itself). Excessive commenting can be as detrimental as too few comments, as they can quickly become outdated and misleading [1].

> "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." [1]

### 2.2. Consistency

Consistency in coding style, naming conventions, and architectural patterns is crucial for a large project. Inconsistent codebases are harder to navigate, understand, and maintain. Developers should strive to match the existing style of the codebase they are working on, even if it deviates slightly from their personal preferences. This includes consistent indentation, brace style, and use of whitespace.

### 2.3. Modularity and Reusability

Design code with modularity in mind. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable units (functions, classes, modules) that perform a single, well-defined task. These modules should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive. This approach promotes reusability, making it easier to incorporate existing components into new features and reducing redundant code. Reusable components also simplify testing and debugging [2].

### 2.4. Testability

Write code that is inherently testable. This often means designing components with clear interfaces and minimizing dependencies. Avoid global state and tightly coupled components, as these can make it difficult to isolate and test individual units of code. Unit tests should be written for all new features and bug fixes, ensuring that the code behaves as expected and preventing regressions.

### 2.5. Performance and Efficiency

While readability and maintainability are paramount, performance and efficiency should also be considered. Optimize critical sections of code, but avoid premature optimization. Profile code to identify bottlenecks before attempting to optimize, as perceived performance issues may not be the actual cause. Efficient algorithms and data structures should be preferred where appropriate, especially for operations that handle large datasets or are frequently executed.

### 2.6. Security

Security is a critical aspect of any e-commerce platform. All code must be written with security best practices in mind. This includes proper input validation, output encoding, secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information), and protection against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted.

## 3. Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions are vital for code readability and maintainability. This section outlines the naming conventions to be followed for various elements within the KSAP platform.

### 3.1. General Naming Guidelines

*   **Descriptive and Unambiguous:** Names should clearly indicate the purpose or content of the entity they represent. Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood within the domain (e.g., `HTTP`, `API`).
*   **Pronounceable:** Names should be easy to pronounce, as this aids in communication and discussion among team members.
*   **Searchable:** Use names that are easy to search for within the codebase. Avoid single-letter variable names unless their scope is extremely limited (e.g., loop counters like `i`, `j`, `k`).
*   **Avoid Hungarian Notation:** Do not prefix variable names with their data types (e.g., `strName`, `intCount`). Modern IDEs and type-hinting features make this unnecessary and can lead to cluttered code.

### 3.2. Specific Naming Conventions

#### 3.2.1. Variables and Function Parameters

*   **Style:** `snake_case` (all lowercase, words separated by underscores).
*   **Examples:** `user_name`, `total_price`, `calculate_discount`.

#### 3.2.2. Functions and Methods

*   **Style:** `snake_case`.
*   **Verbs for Actions:** Functions that perform an action should start with a verb (e.g., `get_user_data`, `save_record`, `process_order`).
*   **Examples:** `authenticate_user()`, `fetch_product_details()`, `update_inventory()`.

#### 3.2.3. Classes

*   **Style:** `PascalCase` (first letter of each word capitalized, no separators).
*   **Nouns for Entities:** Classes should represent entities or concepts and be named as nouns.
*   **Examples:** `User`, `Product`, `OrderProcessor`, `PaymentGateway`.

#### 3.2.4. Modules and Packages

*   **Style:** `snake_case`.
*   **Examples:** `user_management`, `product_catalog`, `payment_processing`.

#### 3.2.5. Constants

*   **Style:** `ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE` (all uppercase, words separated by underscores).
*   **Examples:** `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`, `API_KEY`.

#### 3.2.6. Database Tables and Columns

*   **Style:** `snake_case`.
*   **Plural for Tables:** Table names should generally be plural (e.g., `users`, `products`, `orders`).
*   **Singular for Columns:** Column names should be singular (e.g., `id`, `name`, `price`).
*   **Foreign Keys:** Foreign key columns should be named `related_table_singular_id` (e.g., `user_id`, `product_id`).

## 4. Code Formatting

Consistent code formatting improves readability and reduces cognitive load when reviewing code. This section outlines the formatting rules to be applied across the KSAP platform.

### 4.1. Indentation

*   **Spaces over Tabs:** Always use spaces for indentation. Tabs can render inconsistently across different editors and environments, leading to misalignment and readability issues.
*   **4 Spaces per Indent:** Use 4 spaces for each level of indentation. This is a widely accepted standard in many programming communities and provides a good balance between conciseness and readability.

### 4.2. Line Length

*   **Maximum 120 Characters:** Limit all lines of code to a maximum of 120 characters. While some older conventions suggest 80 characters, modern displays can comfortably accommodate longer lines without horizontal scrolling. Exceeding this limit can make code harder to read and review, especially in side-by-side comparisons.
*   **Breaking Long Lines:** When a line exceeds the maximum length, break it into multiple lines. Indent subsequent lines to align with the start of the expression or logical block. Prioritize breaking at logical points, such as after operators, commas, or opening parentheses.

### 4.3. Whitespace

Strategic use of whitespace enhances readability by visually separating logical blocks and improving the clarity of expressions.

*   **Blank Lines:**
    *   Use two blank lines to separate top-level function and class definitions.
    *   Use one blank line to separate method definitions within a class.
    *   Use blank lines sparingly within functions to indicate logical sections, but avoid excessive use that fragments the code.
*   **Around Operators:** Always put a single space around binary operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `==`, `<`, `>`).
*   **After Commas:** Always put a single space after a comma (`,`) in lists, function arguments, and dictionary items.
*   **Parentheses, Brackets, Braces:**
    *   Do not put whitespace immediately inside parentheses, brackets, or braces.
    *   `good_example = (1, 2, 3)`
    *   `bad_example = ( 1, 2, 3 )`
*   **Function Calls and Definitions:** Do not put whitespace immediately before the `(` that starts the argument list of a function call or definition.
    *   `good_example = function_call(argument)`
    *   `bad_example = function_call (argument)`

### 4.4. Imports

*   **Organize Imports:** Imports should be grouped in the following order:
    1.  Standard library imports.
    2.  Third-party library imports.
    3.  Local application/library specific imports.
*   **Alphabetical Order:** Within each group, imports should be sorted alphabetically by module name.
*   **Absolute Imports:** Use absolute imports for modules within the project (e.g., `from project.module import function`). Relative imports can lead to confusion and issues in larger projects.
*   **One Import Per Line:** Generally, prefer one import per line for clarity.
    *   `from os import path`
    *   `from sys import argv`

### 4.5. Comments

*   **Docstrings:** All modules, classes, and functions should have docstrings that explain their purpose, arguments, and return values. Use triple double quotes (`"""Docstring"""`) for docstrings.
*   **Inline Comments:** Use inline comments sparingly to explain complex or non-obvious logic. Comments should add value and not simply restate the code. They should be kept up-to-date with code changes.
*   **TODO Comments:** Use `TODO` comments to mark areas that require future attention or improvement. Include your name or initials and the date for tracking purposes (e.g., `# TODO(Manus AI, 2025-07-19): Refactor this function`).

## 5. Version Control (Git) Guidelines

Effective use of Git is crucial for collaborative development and maintaining a clean, traceable project history. This section outlines the Git workflow and best practices for the KSAP platform.

### 5.1. Branching Strategy

We will follow a simplified Git Flow or GitHub Flow branching strategy. The main branches are:

*   **`main` (or `master`):** This branch represents the stable, production-ready code. Only thoroughly tested and reviewed code should be merged into `main`. Direct commits to `main` are strictly prohibited.
*   **`develop`:** This branch integrates all new features and bug fixes. It serves as an integration branch for ongoing development. All feature branches should be merged into `develop`.
*   **Feature Branches:** For every new feature or significant bug fix, create a new branch from `develop`. Name feature branches descriptively (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/payment-gateway-error`). These branches should be short-lived and merged back into `develop` once the work is complete and reviewed.
*   **Hotfix Branches:** For urgent bug fixes in production, create hotfix branches directly from `main`. Once fixed, merge the hotfix branch back into both `main` and `develop`.

### 5.2. Commit Messages

Clear and concise commit messages are essential for understanding the project's history and facilitating code reviews. Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

*   **Subject Line:** The first line of the commit message should be a concise summary (50-72 characters) and written in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature"). It should be followed by a blank line.
*   **Body (Optional):** The body of the commit message should provide a more detailed explanation of *what* changed and *why*. Explain the problem being solved, the approach taken, and any relevant context. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
*   **Referencing Issues:** If the commit relates to a specific issue or task, reference it in the commit message (e.g., `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`).

### 5.3. Pull Requests (PRs)

All code changes, except for minor documentation updates or hotfixes (which still require review), must be submitted via Pull Requests. PRs facilitate code review and ensure quality.

*   **Descriptive Title:** The PR title should clearly summarize the changes.
*   **Detailed Description:** Provide a comprehensive description of the changes, including:
    *   What problem does this PR solve?
    *   How was it solved (technical approach)?
    *   Any relevant screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.
    *   Testing instructions.
    *   References to related issues or tasks.
*   **Code Review:** Request reviews from at least two team members. Address all comments and suggestions before merging.
*   **Squash and Rebase:** Before merging a feature branch into `develop`, consider squashing small, incremental commits into a single, meaningful commit. This keeps the commit history clean and easy to follow. Rebase your branch frequently with `develop` to avoid large merge conflicts.

### 5.4. Git Ignore

Use the `.gitignore` file to prevent untracked and unnecessary files from being committed to the repository. This includes:

*   Build artifacts (e.g., `build/`, `dist/`)
*   Dependency directories (e.g., `node_modules/`, `venv/`)
*   IDE-specific files (e.g., `.idea/`, `.vscode/`)
*   Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, `.env` files)
*   Temporary files and logs
