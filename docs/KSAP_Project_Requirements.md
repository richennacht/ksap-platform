## 3. Technical Specifications and Architecture Design

KSAP will be developed as a modern, scalable, and maintainable web application following a microservices-oriented architecture. This approach will ensure modularity, independent deployability, and resilience. The application will consist of a robust backend API, a dynamic frontend user interface, and a scalable database system.

### 3.1. Overall Architecture

The system will adopt a decoupled architecture, separating the frontend presentation layer from the backend business logic and data management. Communication between the frontend and backend will primarily occur via RESTful APIs. Individual services within the backend will communicate via internal APIs or message queues.

**Diagram 1: High-Level System Architecture**

```mermaid

    A[User] -->|Web Browser| B(Frontend Application - React)
    B -->|RESTful API Calls| C(Backend Services - Flask)
    C -->|Data Storage| D(Database - PostgreSQL)
    C -->|Caching/Messaging| E(Redis)
    C -->|External APIs| F(AI Services, E-commerce Platforms, Social Media APIs)
    F -->|Data Exchange| G(External Data Sources)
```

### 3.2. Technology Stack Selection

To ensure robustness, scalability, and adherence to industry best practices, the following technology stack has been selected:

*   **Frontend:** React.js (with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing, if applicable for performance/SEO needs), Redux Toolkit for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Jest/React Testing Library for testing.
*   **Backend:** Python with Flask (or FastAPI for higher performance, if benchmarks indicate necessity) for API development. SQLAlchemy for ORM, Marshmallow for serialization/deserialization, and Celery for asynchronous tasks.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data storage, chosen for its robustness, extensibility, and ACID compliance. Redis for caching, session management, and message brokering.
*   **Version Control:** Git and GitHub, with a clear branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow or GitHub Flow).
*   **Containerization:** Docker for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
*   **Deployment:** Kubernetes for orchestration (if microservices scale warrants it), otherwise simpler container deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run).
*   **Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for both frontend and backend components.

### 3.3. Backend API Design

The backend will be developed as a set of independent microservices, each responsible for a specific domain (e.g., User Management, Store Management, Order Fulfillment, Analytics, AI Services). This will allow for independent scaling and development.

*   **API Standard:** RESTful API principles, using JSON for request and response bodies.
*   **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API authentication and authorization.
*   **Error Handling:** Consistent and informative error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
*   **Logging & Monitoring:** Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack or Prometheus/Grafana) for effective monitoring and debugging.

### 3.4. Frontend Application Design

The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) built with React, providing a highly interactive and responsive user experience. The design will prioritize usability and intuitive navigation.

*   **Component-Based:** Modular and reusable React components for UI elements.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using a mobile-first approach.
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for predictable state management across the application.
*   **Routing:** React Router for client-side routing.

### 3.5. Database Schema Requirements

The database schema will be designed to support the complex relationships between users, stores, products, orders, and various integrations. It will be normalized to ensure data integrity and optimized for performance.

*   **Key Entities:** Users, Stores, Products, Orders, Customers, Integrations (Shopify, Payment Processors, AI Services), Ad Campaigns, Analytics Data.
*   **Relationships:** Clearly defined relationships between entities (one-to-many, many-to-many).
*   **Indexing:** Appropriate indexing for frequently queried columns to optimize read performance.
*   **Migrations:** Database schema changes will be managed using Alembic (for SQLAlchemy) to ensure smooth updates.
